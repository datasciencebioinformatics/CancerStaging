# Table 1. Statistics of up-regulated genes in the three LUSC stages.
To do : To re-run scripts with TPM, then to replace the numbers in the table.

# Figure 1. RNA-seq sample composition and gene expression heterogeneity. A: PCA of tumor genes contrasting paired tumor and normal samples. B: Venn diagram of malignant up-regulated genes common to every stage (center) and DEGS (periphery).
To do : To re-generate the figure with CancerStaging_VeenDiagramsFromPairedUp.R

Figure 2. Nucleotide distributions of genes among LUSC stages. A. GC3 (%). B. T2 (%). Red is for stage I, green for stage II and blue for stage III. 
To do : To re-generate the histogramwith CancerStaging_ExpressionMapsStageSpecificRestore.R

Figure 3. Contour plots of gene expression in function of T2 and vertex connectivity for LUSC stages. Most up-regulated CDSs are T2 < 30% and corresponding protein connectivity extends below this threshold over staging, which denotes a tendency for disordered proteins typical of signaling pathways.

# Figure 2: Boxplots of biomarker expression from LUSC (see Tables 2).
To do : A) To re-generate the table to same with criteria. B) To transform the figure 2 into table 2.

# Table 2.  Biomarkers whose fold change is ≥100 and average RPKM ≤ 2.
To do : A) To re-generate the table to same with criteria. B) To re-lable Table 2 to Table 3.





In table 2, we present the biomarkers whose fold change is ≥100 and average RPKM ≤ 2, which should warrant significant signal-to-noise ratio (Figure 2). The markers that met these criteria had average RPKM ≥ 100.
