    Família de gene SPRR tem 6 genes na tabela
    The small proline rich protein (SPRR) gene family encodes a conserved group of cornified envelope (CE) proteins that are part of the human epidermal differentiation complex (EDC).https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7924129/ SPRR1 is expressed in squamous tumors of the lung and this protein family is an important component of the cornified cell envelope, a structure formed beneath the plasma membrane of squamous differentiated cells by extensive cross-linking of several proteins https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5058701/.

    Famílua de gene KRT tem 4 genes 
    The keratin gene family (KRT) is a group of genes that encode proteins that help form the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells. A representative of this family listed in table 3 is KRT16. KRT16 promotes tumorigenicity in LUAD and could be used an independent prognostic marker https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38322947/.
