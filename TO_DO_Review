    Família de gene SPRR tem 6 genes na tabela
    The small proline rich protein (SPRR) gene family encodes a conserved group of cornified envelope (CE) proteins that are part of the human epidermal differentiation complex (EDC).https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7924129/ SPRR1 is expressed in squamous tumors of the lung and this protein family is an important component of the cornified cell envelope, a structure formed beneath the plasma membrane of squamous differentiated cells by extensive cross-linking of several proteins https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5058701/.

    Famílua de gene KRT tem 4 genes 
    The keratin (KRT) gene family is a subset of intermediate filament (IntFil) genes that are involved in cell integrity and structural scaffolding. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024005802#:~:text=Keratins%20(KRTs)%20play%20a%20crucial,Type%20II%20encoding%20basic%20KRTs. Emerging evidence further points to an active role of KRTs in the invasive and metastatic behavior of cancer cells across various epithelial tumors [3,5].
