# Genes from stage I     (numGene, n)    : number of genes of this stage associated to Hallmark X.
# Genes from stage I     (%)             : percentage of genes of this stage associated to Hallmark X.
# Genes from stage II    (numGene, n)    : number of genes of this stage associated to Hallmark X.
# Genes from stage II    (%)             : percentage of genes of this stage associated to Hallmark X.
# Genes from stage III   (numGene, n)    : number of genes of this stage associated to Hallmark X.
# Genes from stage III   (%)             : percentage of genes of this stage associated to Hallmark X.
# Stage III minus I      (Î”)             : number of genes enriched in stage III minus number of genes enriched in stage I
